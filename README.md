This is a generic version of the code to run the simulations in: Sanabria, F., Daniels, C., Gupta, T., & Santos, C. (2019). A computational implementation of the behavior systems approach of the temporal organization of motivated behavior. Behavioural Processes, 166.   

Make sure both files are saved in the same directory, this will be the working directory where the data and figures from the simulation will be saved.
